# library_management
The proposed project “Library Management System” is designed to manage stock and issuance of books in library along with the student’s details. The books in the library can be added to the system by entering the book details, once the book will register the admin can search the book by its ID or keyword.The details of member of the library can also be changed from the admin side. The admin & member both has different login access to view the library data. The management or admin panel can anytime view the total book status and library card status. The main purpose to design the system is to make increase more reliability and flexibility in the existing system. We have adopted a very condensed version of the structure of library management that it maintains the library's collection. It performs tasks such as book transaction management and user creation. It also includes features that allow users to search for their library resources. We use design patterns since it would be the perfect solution for system code arrangement, but it would also render code that is reusable. So for that we will use design pattern to make more comprehensible. We defined the scope usage of the four patterns of design mentioned in the next section.
Features of our application :-
1. Login
2. AddBook
3. Search Book
